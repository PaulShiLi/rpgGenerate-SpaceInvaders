## Dataset
The personality traits model dataset took information from D&D rulebooks, data generated from GPT-3, and a couple websites that listed RPG personality traits.
The backstory model used a dataset containing sample backstories from Elden Ring, fantasy characters, and GPT-3 generated backstories.
The physical description model used descriptions generated by GPT-3. 
Some datasets, like the physical descriptions and personality traits, were very hard to create because there was not very much information available on these subjects. Because of this, we produced some data with GPT-3 using a prompt.
