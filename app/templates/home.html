                Nexus 1.0.0 is able to generate names, personalities, backstories, and physical descriptions. 
                Names consist of first and last names. 
                Personalities are one sentence descriptions. 
                Backstories and physical descriptions are a few sentences long.

                        We used Python, NLTK, Flask, GPT-3, and GPT-2 to make Nexus. 
                        Our text generation models are trained with Distil GPT-2 and datasets with over thousands of entries. 
                        The machine spends many hours processing the data, it learns to imitate what it was given.
